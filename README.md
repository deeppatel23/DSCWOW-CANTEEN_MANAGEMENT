# Apna Canteen

This was an application that we made as a part of hackathon.

Problem Statement - In universities, during breaktime there is a lot of rush for food at canteen. Moreover
break time is limited so it is difficult for students and teachers to have their ordered food on time.

Solution - We have built mobile applications that can help users to order food.
           We also have an admin app that monitors all the orders and adds or deletes various products as per availability.
           
In the end, we were able to make upto <b>top 20</b>.
